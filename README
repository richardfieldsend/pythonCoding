This is the readme file for my Python Coding folder which is managed
using git running on my Raspberry Pi.

To clone a repository type the command:

git clone git@ziggypi:/mnt/extdrive/pythonCoding.git

The programs in the pythonCoding folder are currently:

spellingPractice.py

(these are attempts to write a maths game for Lizzie's homework one
week).

A program to solve the problem set in Lizzie's homework one week. See
