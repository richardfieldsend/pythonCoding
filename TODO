A list of possible changes/improvements for python programs held in
   this directory.


Spelling Practise:
* - retrieve the file name for the spelling suggestions from the
   command line (python spellpractise.py <filename>)

* - extract the 'ask question/get answer/check answer/modify score'
   loop into a function so program becomes OOP 

* - randomise the order of questions

* - Could look at using Python and a speech processor to ask for the
   word audibly.

Mathionaire game:

* Add four possible answers for each question. There would need to be
   code generating the optional answers. Two of these should be
   relatively outlandish, one plausible and the correct answer. 

* Work out how to compile binaries of programs so that they can be run
   without the use of a python binary.

* Check development of Python on Windows. Obviously I don't want to do
   that, but it is what people are comfortable with.
